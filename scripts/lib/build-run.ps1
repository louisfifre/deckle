# Launch via `cmd /c start` instead of `Start-Process -FilePath` so the

# non-foreground PowerShell host makes Windows treat the new process as
# also non-foreground, and the foreground lock policy then silently
# downgrades / defers the WS_EX_TOPMOST flag that HudWindow's
# OverlappedPresenter posts at construction (IsAlwaysOnTop = true). The
# net effect: HUD launches behind every other window for the entire
# session, and only an app restart from Explorer (which routes through
# ShellExecute and gets proper foreground promotion) cures it.
# `cmd /c start "" "<path>"` is the canonical Windows idiom for "launch
# this exe as if the user had double-clicked it from the shell". The
# empty "" is the START title slot — required when the path is quoted,
# otherwise `start` interprets the quoted path as the title and silently
# does nothing.
#
# Post-build mitigation: even with cmd /c start, the first launch right
# after MSBuild has finished still occasionally exhibits the HUD-behind
# glitch (the foreground lock heuristic appears to be sensitive to the
# timing of the PowerShell host that just spawned MSBuild). To work
# around this, we pass --post-build to Deckle.exe so it re-launches
# itself once via cmd /c start after a short delay, then exits. The
# second instance never inherits the post-build foreground state. Pass
# -NoAutoRestart to suppress (debug-attach scenarios).
