// App-side hooks the Settings UI pages and ViewModels need to drive
// concerns that only the App owns: theme broadcast across windows, the
// canonical AudioLevelMapper statics in Deckle.Audio (touched by the
// level-window slider), process restart, and the lazy SettingsWindow
// instance accessor used by dialogs to anchor their XamlRoot.
//
// Why a static delegate registry rather than a project reference back
// to the App assembly? Because that would close the dependency cycle
// (App → Deckle.Settings → App). The pattern mirrors what
// `HudChrono.MaxRecordingDurationSecondsProvider` does in
// Deckle.Chrono.Hud: the lib exposes static fields, the App wires them
// once at boot, the lib's call sites invoke them with `?.Invoke(...)`
// and degrade silently to no-op when nothing is wired (so the lib
// remains buildable / testable in isolation).
//
// All four hooks are intentionally `Action<...>` / `Func<...>` rather
// than a single interface — keeps the surface minimal, no boxing, and
// each hook can be wired independently if a future host implements only
// part of the contract (e.g. a settings preview window without a full
// app shell).

    // tag (e.g. "Deckle.Transcription.WhisperPage, Deckle.Transcription" — assembly-
    // qualified for cross-assembly Type.GetType resolution) so the user
    // lands back on the page that triggered the restart. Wired by App.

    // to avoid taking a back-reference to the App.
