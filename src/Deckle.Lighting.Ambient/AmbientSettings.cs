    // ── HDR tuning (this branch) ───────────────────────────────────
    //
    // Four user-tunable sliders exposed in AmbientPage. Analogous to
    // the basic colour-grading panel of a video editor (exposure /
    // saturation / lift / response curve). Defaults aim at a "Hue
    // Sync-like" presence out of the box on HDR displays — bright and
    // saturated. Each setting is read on every tick by AmbientEngine
    // via the host so changes apply live without restarting the
    // pipeline.
    //
    // Why these four :
    //   - Exposure compensates for scRGB content peaking well below
    //     the display's reported MaxLuminance on a typical scene,
    //     which leaves the post-tone-map output dim. +1 EV roughly
    //     doubles brightness, restoring "Hue Sync" presence.
    //   - Saturation boost compensates for the de-saturation that
    //     happens when spatially averaging bright + dark pixels (the
    //     average drifts toward grey). Applied in OKLCh so hue stays
    //     stable and perceived luminance doesn't drift across the
    //     hue wheel.
    //   - Min brightness compensates for HueColorMath deriving bri
    //     from max(R,G,B) — a mid-tone scene like (60, 40, 80) gives
    //     bri ≈ 31 %, dim enough that the lamp's diffuser swallows
    //     the colour. A floor of ~180 keeps the chromaticity
    //     readable on the lamp without manual scene-by-scene
    //     adjustment.
    //   - Brightness curve gamma squashes the bottom of the bri range
    //     via a power law on max(R,G,B). The linear default reads as
    //     visibly lit in a dark room on dim scenes (max ≈ 25/255 still
    //     pushes bri ≈ 25). gamma > 1 stretches the bottom of the
    //     range without touching saturated highlights : (max/255)^γ ×
    //     254. gamma = 1.0 disables. Applied as a uniform RGB scale
    //     so xy chromaticity stays invariant — only bri drops.
