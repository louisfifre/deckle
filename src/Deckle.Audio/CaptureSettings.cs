// Persisted dBFS window used to map raw microphone RMS
// onto the [0, 1] perceptual level driving the Recording stroke. Exposed
// as Settings so the user can calibrate against their own mic+DSP chain
// without rebuilding — the values land in AudioLevelMapper at app startup
// and on every change.
//
// Defaults match the shipping calibration:
//   Min  -55 dBFS — below typical p25 silence band, well above the
//                   -97 dBFS digital floor / DSP gate.
//   Max  -32 dBFS — measured peak ceiling for normal voice.
//   Exp   1.0    — linear response. Higher = compress low end / expand
//                  high end; lower = the opposite. The HUD reads "soit
//                  là, soit pas là" with a linear ramp.
//
// AutoCalibration runs a rolling heuristic over the last N microphone
// telemetry samples: median(p25) - 5 dB -> MinDbfs, median(p90) + 5 dB
// -> MaxDbfs, with clamps in the calculator. Off by default — the user
// has to opt in to recurring visual-feedback tweaks. Manual sliders
// override the auto values until auto runs again.
