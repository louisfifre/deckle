// ── AudioLevelMapper ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Pure mic-RMS-to-perceptual-level mapping. Lives in Deckle.Audio
// because it's signal processing of microphone data — sister concept to
// MicrophoneCapture (the source) and CaptureSettings.LevelWindow (the
// calibration). Any UI module that wants to react to live mic level
// (HUD stroke opacity today, Ask-Ollama text glow tomorrow) reads
// `RmsToPerceptualLevel` and consumes the [0, 1] result however it
// wants.
//
// The four public statics double as Playground tunables — the Playground
// slider page mutates them live to explore the curve shape. Atomic float
// reads: the audio thread reads RmsToPerceptualLevel concurrently with
// the UI thread writing the statics. Single-precision float writes are
// atomic on all .NET platforms; no lock needed.
//
// Auto-calibration (engine-side) and manual sliders (Settings ▸ General
// ▸ Recording) write through `App.ApplyLevelWindow` which forwards into
// these statics. Defaults match the shipping calibration documented in
// CaptureSettings.LevelWindowSettings.
//
// Extracted from Controls/HudChrono.xaml.cs on 2026-05-02 — was on the
// HUD control by historical accident; the math is purely audio-domain.

    // aggressively in the upper half of the window.

    //   rms ≤ 0.010 (-40 dBFS)  → t=0.00  → y=0.00   silence / gate
    //   rms = 0.018 (-35 dBFS)  → t=0.28  → y=0.08   breath / ambient
    //   rms = 0.032 (-30 dBFS)  → t=0.56  → y=0.31   soft onset
    //   rms = 0.040 (-28 dBFS)  → t=0.67  → y=0.44   conversational

    // Calibration — typical voice peaks around -18 dBFS but the 50 ms
    // RMS average sits 6-10 dB below peak, landing in -28..-24 dBFS for
    // normal speech and brushing -22 dBFS only on emphatic stress.
    // Previous ceiling at -18 dBFS was unreachable in practice:
    // conversational RMS reached y ≈ 0.30 and even loud speech stayed
    // below y=0.55, so the stroke barely lit up during real recordings
    // (the playground's sim pump masked this because its peak value
    // saturated the upper range). The -22 dBFS ceiling puts
    // conversational RMS at y=0.44-0.79 — clearly visible, with real
    // dynamics — and the quadratic curve keeps the low-end soft so
    // ambient noise still fades to zero.
    //
    // MinDbfs -40: matches the engine's noise-gate threshold, so the
    // visual floor coincides with the audible floor. Default −55 here
    // is the auto-calibration starting point; the engine retunes it
    // session-by-session if AutoCalibrationEnabled is on.
