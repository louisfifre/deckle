// Recording/Transcribing/Rewriting drive the Composition stroke; Charging
// is the cold-boot "parked clock" with neutral digits; Hidden tears the
// stroke down. Message is technically a HudWindow-level state (the chrono
// itself is hidden when the HUD is in Message mode) — it lives here so the
// hosting state machine can pass a single enum to ApplyState without an
// extra mapping table.
