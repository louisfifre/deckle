namespace Deckle.Lighting;

// Driver-facing abstraction for the "downstream" half of the ambient
// lighting pipeline. The contract is intentionally small : connect to
// whatever sink the user picked (Hue bridge via REST, future Home
// Assistant instance over HTTP/WebSocket, WLED node over DDP, DMX
// universe via Art-Net, …), push a single sRGB colour at whatever
// cadence the consumer chooses, disconnect cleanly. The single-colour
// surface is the lowest-common-denominator path — every driver supports
// it, every consumer can use it. Drivers that can address individual
// lights independently within their connected scope also implement
// <see cref="IMultiLightOutput"/> ; consumers query for the capability
// with a runtime cast and fall back to the single-colour push if the
// driver doesn't expose it.
//
// Lifecycle.
//   - Construction is cheap and synchronous ; the driver carries
//     configuration (bridge IP + app key for Hue, server URL + token
//     for HA, etc.) but doesn't touch the network.
//   - ConnectAsync performs any handshake / probe / session start
//     required by the protocol ; it must succeed before SetColorAsync
//     is called.
//   - SetColorAsync is non-allocating-friendly (the LightColor struct
//     is value-typed) and must tolerate being called at the cadence
//     the protocol can sustain. Drivers that can't keep up should drop
//     intermediate pushes (last-write-wins) rather than queue.
//   - DisposeAsync stops the session and releases the network
//     resources ; idempotent.
//
// Threading. Methods are not required to be thread-safe ; the
// consumer is expected to serialise calls (typical pattern : push from
// a single background task that polls the analysis output). Drivers
// that need to coordinate background work (DTLS keep-alive, WebSocket
// reconnect, …) own their own synchronisation internally.

// Capability sub-interface : exposed by drivers that can address
// individual lights independently within the connected scope. AmbientEngine
// queries with `output is IMultiLightOutput` at start ; if yes, the
// multi-light pipeline runs (one colour per light, per-light placement
// drives the screen sampling), otherwise it falls back to the
// <see cref="ILightOutput.SetColorAsync"/> path with a single average
// colour.
//
// Why a separate interface vs. an optional method on ILightOutput :
//   - Some drivers truly can't address individual fixtures (a single
//     DMX universe driving one parallel-wired strip ; an Art-Net node
//     in single-zone mode). Forcing them to implement a stub would
//     either lie (no-op SetLightColorsAsync) or throw at runtime
//     (NotSupportedException pollutes the consumer code). A capability
//     interface lets the consumer make the right decision up front.
//   - The list of addressable lights is a property of the connected
//     scope (one group, one HA area, one WLED segment range) — it's
//     resolved at ConnectAsync time, then cached for the session. The
//     consumer uses it once to drive placement UI ; it doesn't poll.
